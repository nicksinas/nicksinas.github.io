               Hi, I'm Nick Sinas. I have over 10 years of experience leading engineering teams, and delivering elegant, innovative products.
               I love turning crazy ideas to something real. I thrive on solving tough challenges, building world-class teams, and figuring out how we are going to get from here to done. <br /> <br />               
               I have a passion for leading teams building IoT products - this includes Product Strategists, Industrial Designers, Mechanical Engineers, Hardware Engineers, Firmware Engineers, Software Engineers, and Manufacturing Engineers. <br /> <br />
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wxZt4-3ybI">Here</a> is a video of me participating in a recent panel on IoT.  <br /> <br />
               Please reach out if you need help from someone like me, or just want to chat about tech products.
